side bar links are not getting highlighted even when i use class="active"
how to make forms page interactive (no table then display table when click on forms tab)
form and field have to be tabs or can be buttons
does everything have to look exactly like how it looks in the moqups?
do the forms and forms-field need to have a border around the table and data?
